  <p>Posters: Posters have a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. Posters also evolved alongside the advancements in printing technology. Jules Chéret is the father of modern poster design, revolutionizing the medium with vibrant lithographic prints around 1860. By the 1890s, posters became popular advertising and art, particularly in Europe and the U.S. Influential artists like Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha further elevated posters into collectible art. Posters also became powerful political, cultural, and commercial messaging tools, shaping visual culture worldwide.</p>
  <p>Lighters: Early lighters in the 16th century were adapted from firearms, using gunpowder and a complex mechanism to ignite sparks. Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner's 1816 invention used hydrogen, though it was unstable. Carl Auer von Welsbach's 1908 flint lighter paved the way for modern designs. By the 1920s, smoking's popularity led to sleek, portable lighters, like those by Zippo in 1932. The inclusion of butane in the 1930s improved flame control. Today, innovations like piezoelectric and USB-charged plasma lighters are standard.</p>
  <p>Pie: Pie has a long and rich history, dating back to ancient civilizations. The earliest pies were likely created by the Egyptians and Greeks, with the Greeks using pastry to enclose meat. Romans refined the technique, developing bottom and top crusts for pie. In medieval England, pies became popular, evolving into savory and sweet varieties. By the 16th century, fruit pies emerged. In America, pies like pumpkin, pecan, and apple became iconic, while innovations like canned fruit and ready-made crusts modernized pie-making.</p>
